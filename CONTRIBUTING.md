## üéØ Project Goals

- **Democratize AI**: Make AI accessible to everyone without paywalls or privacy concerns
- **User-Friendly**: Maintain a simple, intuitive interface that anyone can use
- **Local-First**: Ensure everything runs locally with no external dependencies
- **Open Source**: Keep the project transparent and community-driven

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Emile-1.git
   cd Emile-1
   ```
3. **Set up the development environment**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_txt.txt
   ```
4. **Run the app** to make sure everything works:
   ```bash
   streamlit run emile_complete_app.py
   ```

## üõ† Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small

### UI/UX Principles
- **Simplicity**: Keep the interface clean and uncluttered
- **Accessibility**: Ensure features are easy to discover and use
- **Responsiveness**: Test on different screen sizes
- **Feedback**: Provide clear status messages and error handling

### Testing
- Test with multiple Ollama models
- Verify file upload functionality with different file types
- Ensure chat saving/loading works correctly
- Test error scenarios (Ollama not running, invalid files, etc.)

## üåü Contribution Ideas

### High Priority
- **PDF Support**: Enable PDF file uploads for document analysis
- **Dark Mode**: Add theme toggle for better user experience
- **Better Error Handling**: More informative error messages
- **Performance Metrics**: Show response times and token counts

### Medium Priority
- **System Prompts**: Allow users to customize the AI's behavior
- **Conversation Search**: Search through saved chat history
- **Model Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of different models
- **Export Options**: Export chats to different formats (PDF, Word, etc.)

### Nice to Have
- **Voice Input**: Speech-to-text integration
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom features
- **Multi-language**: Support for non-English interfaces
- **Mobile App**: React Native or Flutter companion app
